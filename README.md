#Simple Grocery List App

This is a no-frills application for keeping track of one's groceries. The goal of this project was to sharpen my React skills and to dip my toes in the ocean that is the Flux architecture.

The frontend views are driven by React and the backend is Express with data being persisted in mongodb. I still don't fully understand the ins-and-outs of FLux. Must study more.

Onward and upward!
